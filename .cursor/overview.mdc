# Dots Repository Overview

> **Note:** Always consult the latest `README.md` file in this repository for the most up-to-date and authoritative information about setup, structure, and usage.

This repository contains personal dotfiles and configuration files for various applications and tools. It is designed to work in conjunction with the `workstation-builder` repository for a complete Linux workstation setup.

## Purpose
- Manage user-specific configurations
- Store application-specific dotfiles
- Provide personal preferences and settings
- Configure themes and appearance

## Structure
- `config/`: Application configurations (e.g., Hyprland, Alacritty, Ranger)
- `bin/`: Custom scripts and utilities
- `docs/`: Detailed documentation for specific configurations
- `zshrc`, `vimrc`, `aliases`: Shell and editor configurations

## Testing
To test dotfiles configuration:
```bash
cd ~/workspace/dots
rcup -v
```
- Use `rcup -v` for verbose output to see what's being applied

## Relationship to workstation-builder
- `workstation-builder` handles system-level setup and package installation
- `dots` manages user-level and application-specific configuration
- Together, they provide a modular, reproducible workstation environment
